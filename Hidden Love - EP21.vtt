ADAPTED FROM THE NOVEL
HIDDEN LOVE BY ZHU YI

02:00.920 --> 02:01.880
He fell asleep.

02:03.160 --> 02:04.040
I'm going to go now.

02:06.640 --> 02:07.880
I've been holding back all day.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.560
Can you take the passenger seat?

02:17.640 --> 02:19.440
Jiaxu isn't your driver.

02:20.360 --> 02:22.600
So? I've been your driver so many times.

02:22.680 --> 02:23.760
Can't he be one for me once?

02:27.280 --> 02:28.120
Bye.

02:30.960 --> 02:32.000
Okay, fine!

02:32.080 --> 02:33.440
Wait! My seat belt is still on!

02:34.200 --> 02:35.120
You…

02:38.640 --> 02:40.200
What's wrong with you?

02:40.280 --> 02:41.240
I'll move.

02:42.840 --> 02:44.560
Text me when you reach your dorm.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.800
-"Text me."
-Bye.

02:46.880 --> 02:47.800
"Bye."

02:47.880 --> 02:48.760
I'm off.

03:17.080 --> 03:18.800
I'll drive you home first.

03:18.880 --> 03:20.320
I need to head back to the office.

03:21.240 --> 03:22.960
Do you still have to work?

03:23.040 --> 03:24.680
It's so late now.

03:25.400 --> 03:26.520
I know.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.600
I had to accompany my darling brother,

03:28.680 --> 03:30.200
so I have to catch up on work tonight.

03:32.720 --> 03:34.960
It's fine. I'll go with you.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.680
I'm curious about how you work at night.

03:40.640 --> 03:41.520
Sure.

03:42.760 --> 03:43.760
Thank you, darling brother.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.280
Cut it out.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.160
THE DREAM GAMES

03:55.600 --> 03:57.560
Why did you have to squeeze in here

03:58.240 --> 03:59.880
instead of enjoying the bed at home?

04:00.560 --> 04:01.400
It's all the same.

04:01.480 --> 04:03.760
I'm just gaming at a different place.

04:08.440 --> 04:09.360
I have a question.

04:10.240 --> 04:11.600
Are you working overtime

04:11.680 --> 04:13.760
on top of picking up the little demon

04:13.840 --> 04:15.400
from work,

04:16.040 --> 04:17.399
having dinner, going shopping,

04:17.480 --> 04:19.120
and watching a movie with her?

04:20.959 --> 04:23.320
A while ago, my superior fell sick,

04:23.400 --> 04:24.360
so I was quite busy.

04:25.160 --> 04:26.480
But things are better now.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.360
Today is an exception.

04:28.440 --> 04:30.440
Don't ruin your health just to date.

04:32.120 --> 04:33.560
Actually, you can tell her.

04:33.640 --> 04:36.800
The little demon isn't sensible,

04:36.880 --> 04:38.640
but she will understand.

04:38.720 --> 04:40.040
If she was sensible enough,

04:40.120 --> 04:41.560
I would do whatever she wishes.

04:43.360 --> 04:44.600
It's fine.

04:44.680 --> 04:46.480
I'm moving to a new place soon.

04:46.560 --> 04:47.720
The situation will improve.

04:49.160 --> 04:50.280
New place?

04:50.920 --> 04:52.160
Why are you moving?

04:53.560 --> 04:56.080
My current place is too small

04:56.160 --> 04:58.160
and far away from her campus.

04:58.240 --> 04:59.960
I found a new apartment

05:00.040 --> 05:01.480
with two bedrooms

05:01.560 --> 05:02.720
and it's near her campus.

05:03.680 --> 05:05.400
You won't have to be so worried.

05:06.960 --> 05:08.360
As if.

05:12.800 --> 05:14.560
Duan Jiaxu, you know me.

05:15.560 --> 05:16.800
As her brother,

05:18.360 --> 05:20.840
I'll worry since my sister is dating.

05:23.680 --> 05:24.720
Do you remember the mess

05:24.800 --> 05:26.120
when she went to see that guy

05:27.160 --> 05:28.280
she met online?

05:31.560 --> 05:32.920
But in the past few days,

05:35.720 --> 05:37.480
I have felt relieved

05:40.040 --> 05:41.600
that you are her boyfriend.

05:50.600 --> 05:51.720
But mark my words.

05:52.560 --> 05:56.040
If you ever dare to hurt my sister,

05:56.920 --> 05:58.680
I will make sure you pay for it.

06:03.280 --> 06:04.160
It's a shame

06:05.040 --> 06:06.400
that you won't have this chance.

06:12.280 --> 06:13.640
So about working late tonight…

06:13.720 --> 06:15.320
No worries. I won't tell her.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.400
I'm not that clueless.

06:19.560 --> 06:20.720
Continue with your work.

06:20.800 --> 06:21.800
Thank you, darling brother.

06:38.560 --> 06:41.200
CHAPTER 21, RELIANCE

06:41.280 --> 06:43.760
I AM BECAUSE YOU ARE

06:47.280 --> 06:48.520
Hello. Good morning.

06:55.320 --> 06:56.680
Did he sleep here again?

06:56.760 --> 06:57.760
He worked overtime.

06:58.400 --> 06:59.280
Again?

07:07.840 --> 07:11.280
I'M GOING BACK TO YOUR PLACE FIRST

07:30.000 --> 07:31.040
Jiaxu, good morning.

07:31.120 --> 07:31.960
Good morning.

07:33.240 --> 07:34.600
Did you stay here again yesterday?

07:37.800 --> 07:39.600
I saw your girlfriend at the KTV

07:39.680 --> 07:41.080
a few days ago.

07:41.160 --> 07:42.800
-Really?
-Yes.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.080
I saw her in the corridor

07:44.160 --> 07:46.920
with the girl who made a scene downstairs.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.240
They were talking.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.560
Jiaxu, I'll get back to my work.

07:54.400 --> 07:55.320
Go ahead.

08:02.720 --> 08:04.680
If anything falls off,
come back to see me.

08:04.760 --> 08:05.880
-I'll fix it for free.
-Sure.

08:05.960 --> 08:07.200
-I'll get going. Bye.
-Bye.

08:18.120 --> 08:19.080
Duan Jiaxu?

08:20.160 --> 08:21.280
What brings you here?

08:24.240 --> 08:26.120
Would you like anything to drink? Water?

08:26.760 --> 08:28.800
What you did to me constitutes harassment.

08:28.880 --> 08:30.400
If you go to her again,

08:30.480 --> 08:31.800
I'll consider calling the police.

08:40.080 --> 08:40.919
Police?

08:43.440 --> 08:44.320
Jiang Ying.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.840
You've been bugging me for many years

08:47.920 --> 08:49.000
and I've let it go.

08:49.720 --> 08:50.640
I can tolerate it all.

08:52.480 --> 08:54.160
But if you hurt her,

08:55.960 --> 08:57.280
the girl I love,

08:59.040 --> 09:01.200
I can do anything for her sake.

09:19.440 --> 09:21.680
PUBLIC SECURITY
ADMINISTRATIVE PUNISHMENTS LAW

09:21.760 --> 09:23.960
According to our statistics,

09:24.440 --> 09:25.720
the users of Dongjie

09:25.800 --> 09:27.480
prioritize ingredients and additives

09:27.560 --> 09:30.120
when choosing skincare products.

09:30.200 --> 09:31.800
So we would like to showcase

09:31.880 --> 09:35.400
the production of the main ingredients
and extraction process

09:35.480 --> 09:36.640
in the animation.

09:36.720 --> 09:38.960
This will give the audience a clearer view

09:39.040 --> 09:40.200
of the product's safety.

09:45.920 --> 09:46.920
Any thoughts on this?

09:48.720 --> 09:50.560
The target audience of this product

09:50.640 --> 09:52.640
are individuals
with allergic skin conditions

09:52.720 --> 09:54.480
and individuals with sensitive skin.

09:54.560 --> 09:57.560
I believe the users will be concerned
about the safety of the ingredients.

09:57.640 --> 09:58.600
I think

09:58.680 --> 10:00.920
Xiaoyu's idea is quite good.

10:01.840 --> 10:03.120
I don't care what you think,

10:03.200 --> 10:04.240
I only care what I think.

10:04.320 --> 10:06.240
I think your opinion isn't accurate.

10:06.320 --> 10:07.200
What do you think?

10:07.280 --> 10:09.040
What the users are concerned about

10:09.120 --> 10:10.880
are not necessarily our clients' concerns.

10:10.960 --> 10:12.280
They value nothing but sales.

10:13.120 --> 10:14.120
Mr. Zhang.

10:14.200 --> 10:16.520
Dongjie's products are high-priced.

10:16.600 --> 10:18.760
Their user base mainly consists of people

10:18.840 --> 10:20.280
between 26 and 36.

10:20.360 --> 10:23.000
Ladies within this age range
don't mind spending money.

10:23.080 --> 10:24.200
Instead, they're concerned

10:24.280 --> 10:26.080
about getting unsafe products
for their money.

10:26.160 --> 10:27.720
That's why we went in this direction.

10:27.800 --> 10:30.320
Dongjie is a well-established brand

10:30.400 --> 10:32.080
in the market.

10:32.840 --> 10:34.240
Do you think it's meaningful

10:34.320 --> 10:36.200
when you advertise the ingredients?

10:36.720 --> 10:38.720
I want bold and creative ideas.

10:38.800 --> 10:41.400
Only by doing so can we help our clients

10:41.480 --> 10:42.760
attract new customers.

10:43.840 --> 10:45.680
This idea is indeed not persuasive enough.

10:46.440 --> 10:49.200
Let's hear Xiaoyu's other ideas.

10:50.680 --> 10:51.560
-Mr. Zhang--
-Enough.

10:51.640 --> 10:52.680
You can save it.

10:53.440 --> 10:55.400
Does anyone else have ideas?

10:56.480 --> 10:57.360
You?

11:00.320 --> 11:01.600
The two of you?

11:04.200 --> 11:06.480
I have a tiny idea.

11:08.640 --> 11:09.480
Go on.

11:10.760 --> 11:12.400
Can we

11:12.480 --> 11:15.200
portray the products
as animated characters?

11:18.840 --> 11:19.680
Previously,

11:20.240 --> 11:22.640
the client mentioned three focal points.

11:22.720 --> 11:24.720
One, storytelling.

11:24.800 --> 11:26.360
Two, product functionality.

11:26.440 --> 11:29.120
Three, garnering public attention.

11:29.200 --> 11:31.680
So can we use

11:32.200 --> 11:33.960
an animated character

11:34.040 --> 11:36.160
combined with the product

11:36.240 --> 11:38.640
to create a story in the ad

11:38.720 --> 11:40.960
to highlight the function of the product?

11:41.480 --> 11:43.440
We can also make use

11:43.520 --> 11:44.640
of some current hot topics

11:44.720 --> 11:47.800
to generate more public interest
in the product

11:47.880 --> 11:50.240
and reach out to a wider audience.

11:50.800 --> 11:51.760
Are you positive

11:51.840 --> 11:54.560
that using a story plot

11:54.640 --> 11:57.320
can help raise Dongjie's sales?

12:02.560 --> 12:04.280
Yes, as someone

12:04.360 --> 12:07.000
who has had allergies since I was little.

12:07.080 --> 12:09.600
So if I were to see this ad,

12:09.680 --> 12:12.840
it might evoke some childhood memories.

12:12.920 --> 12:15.240
Perhaps we can narrow the scope

12:15.320 --> 12:16.800
to the allergic cluster.

12:16.880 --> 12:19.000
If anyone with allergies watches this ad,

12:19.080 --> 12:21.720
they may want to try the product.

12:22.800 --> 12:24.480
That's an interesting idea.

12:24.560 --> 12:25.440
Go into detail.

12:26.400 --> 12:27.480
Detail?

12:27.560 --> 12:29.960
-Details.
-I haven't thought about the details yet.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.200
I think

12:35.280 --> 12:37.640
the story of a little girl

12:37.720 --> 12:40.680
doesn't align with the image
of Dongjie's product.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.080
It's a bit too childish.

12:43.160 --> 12:45.280
But I think it's pretty good.

12:45.360 --> 12:46.400
It's interesting.

12:46.480 --> 12:47.920
For both of your ideas,

12:48.000 --> 12:49.400
one is about function,

12:49.480 --> 12:51.080
while the other one is about creativity.

12:51.160 --> 12:53.680
Anyway, the client has the final say.

12:54.400 --> 12:57.280
I suggest making proposals for both

12:57.360 --> 12:58.520
and letting the client choose.

12:59.840 --> 13:01.120
I agree with Mr. Zhang.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.320
I agree with your agreement.

13:03.240 --> 13:04.360
So let's proceed this way.

13:04.440 --> 13:07.200
Dongjie is our biggest client.

13:07.280 --> 13:09.160
We must not lose this client,

13:09.240 --> 13:12.080
so we must make sure to satisfy Dongjie.

13:12.160 --> 13:13.240
Understood?

13:13.920 --> 13:15.160
Understood.

13:15.720 --> 13:16.920
Very good.

13:17.000 --> 13:18.160
Young lady,

13:18.240 --> 13:20.120
your idea is creative and bold.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.360
Okay, let's call it a day.

13:29.320 --> 13:31.600
Are you a Yihe University student?

13:32.440 --> 13:33.320
A freshman.

13:34.320 --> 13:35.320
Keep up the good work.

13:37.520 --> 13:38.400
Sang Zhi, come here.

13:38.480 --> 13:40.160
I'll send you the project material.

13:40.240 --> 13:41.800
-Go back and study it.
-Sure.

13:45.000 --> 13:45.960
Xiaoyu,

13:46.040 --> 13:47.720
I need you to review a project.

13:55.680 --> 13:57.360
Make this part bigger.

13:57.440 --> 13:58.480
Okay, next page.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.240
This part is quite good.

14:04.320 --> 14:05.200
Xiaoyu.

14:08.120 --> 14:09.240
Sang Zhi.

14:15.040 --> 14:15.920
Xiaoyu.

14:16.760 --> 14:18.000
I'll submit the proposal to you

14:18.080 --> 14:19.240
after I complete it.

14:19.320 --> 14:20.320
No need to send it to me.

14:26.200 --> 14:27.240
You're an intern.

14:28.240 --> 14:30.040
Do you not know the company rules?

14:31.640 --> 14:34.560
You're my subordinate.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.280
You should've reported to me

14:36.960 --> 14:38.520
if you have ideas or proposals

14:38.600 --> 14:40.240
instead of mentioning them in the meeting.

14:40.320 --> 14:41.600
What was your intent?

14:42.640 --> 14:43.920
What do you want?

14:44.000 --> 14:45.160
To show off that you're smart?

14:47.200 --> 14:48.080
No.

14:49.560 --> 14:50.640
I'm sorry, Xiaoyu.

14:50.720 --> 14:51.720
I just…

14:53.120 --> 14:54.280
But I should've expected it.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.240
Someone who steals
someone else's boyfriend

14:58.040 --> 14:59.080
wouldn't care about the rules.

15:18.560 --> 15:19.560
It's blazing hot in Yihe.

15:23.320 --> 15:24.520
Have you been waiting long?

15:24.600 --> 15:25.520
Not really.

15:26.440 --> 15:27.400
Where is Duan Jiaxu?

15:28.280 --> 15:29.640
He went to buy a drink for you.

15:33.680 --> 15:34.760
I heard

15:35.400 --> 15:36.680
that you always work extra hours.

15:37.760 --> 15:39.800
It happens to all interns.

15:42.560 --> 15:43.840
Well, while you're working,

15:44.760 --> 15:46.640
take care of yourself and get enough rest.

15:47.200 --> 15:48.480
I'm flying back tomorrow morning

15:48.560 --> 15:49.880
and I have something to do later,

15:49.960 --> 15:50.800
so I'm leaving now.

15:57.240 --> 15:58.720
Flying back tomorrow morning?

16:01.920 --> 16:03.480
What's wrong with you?

16:03.560 --> 16:05.360
You're leaving after only a few days.

16:05.440 --> 16:07.360
I need to go back
to deal with a lot of things.

16:07.440 --> 16:09.600
You should've told me earlier.

16:09.680 --> 16:11.840
I could've taken yesterday off

16:11.920 --> 16:13.280
to show you around Yihe.

16:13.840 --> 16:16.360
No, I wouldn't like your idea of fun,
little demon.

16:16.440 --> 16:17.280
Forget it.

16:18.600 --> 16:19.440
Well…

16:20.920 --> 16:22.440
Can't you stay here

16:23.280 --> 16:24.520
for two more days?

16:24.600 --> 16:25.800
I…

16:25.880 --> 16:26.760
What?

16:26.840 --> 16:28.240
I…

16:32.560 --> 16:35.320
Don't you feel embarrassed crying

16:35.400 --> 16:36.680
outside your workplace?

16:37.280 --> 16:38.120
Well…

16:39.800 --> 16:41.760
I have nothing to do here.

16:41.840 --> 16:44.000
I'm just sitting on his couch every day

16:44.080 --> 16:45.840
like his watchdog.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.080
I mean it.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.280
Hey.

16:53.400 --> 16:54.880
Something is wrong with you.

16:54.960 --> 16:56.400
Are you unhappy with your internship?

17:00.280 --> 17:01.480
I knew it. Here's the thing.

17:01.560 --> 17:02.440
Listen.

17:02.520 --> 17:05.040
If you're not happy, just quit the job.

17:05.119 --> 17:07.440
We have enough money
to feed ourselves, right?

17:08.280 --> 17:10.240
I give you more than that chump change.

17:11.319 --> 17:13.240
How about this? I'll talk to your boss.

17:13.319 --> 17:15.119
I won't allow anyone to bully my sister.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.280
-Got it?
-What happened?

17:16.839 --> 17:18.240
Duan Jiaxu, come quickly.

17:18.319 --> 17:19.280
Come and cheer her up.

17:19.359 --> 17:20.440
What's going on?

17:20.520 --> 17:22.200
-Comfort her.
-Stop bullying your sister.

17:22.280 --> 17:24.119
It's not me. She said it's her internship.

17:24.200 --> 17:25.200
-She's unhappy.
-I didn't.

17:26.560 --> 17:27.680
He's talking nonsense.

17:28.240 --> 17:29.760
You blocked me

17:29.840 --> 17:31.000
and stole my red packets.

17:31.560 --> 17:33.320
That's why I'm upset.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.960
I was just messing with you.

17:35.040 --> 17:36.440
I'll give you back the red packets.

17:36.520 --> 17:37.960
Fine. Stop talking.

17:41.200 --> 17:42.760
Here. Drink this.

17:46.480 --> 17:48.680
Duan Jiaxu, I have plans later.

17:49.280 --> 17:50.720
Send her home first.

17:50.800 --> 17:52.080
I can give you a ride.

17:52.160 --> 17:53.160
No, it's too much trouble.

17:53.240 --> 17:54.480
It's in the opposite direction.

17:55.080 --> 17:56.960
All right. You guys talk. I'm off.

18:03.200 --> 18:04.960
You've got Duan Jiaxu. Aren't you happy?

18:06.240 --> 18:07.440
Bye, little demon.

18:16.640 --> 18:18.400
Is your boss on the second floor?

18:19.320 --> 18:20.640
No…

18:21.640 --> 18:22.640
-What?
-Let's go.

18:22.720 --> 18:23.560
Let's go.

18:30.800 --> 18:31.680
Have you been

18:33.040 --> 18:34.520
in a bad mood lately?

18:37.280 --> 18:39.120
I thought you hadn't talked about work

18:39.200 --> 18:41.280
because you weren't having trouble.

18:44.840 --> 18:48.440
There aren't that many troubles at work.

18:49.080 --> 18:49.920
I…

18:50.720 --> 18:52.840
I feel that I can handle it myself.

18:54.120 --> 18:55.400
You're busy with your work.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.040
I don't want to give you more pressure.

19:01.320 --> 19:03.560
You used to cry a lot in front of me.

19:04.320 --> 19:05.640
Why do you feel embarrassed now?

19:05.720 --> 19:07.600
That was when I was a kid.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.560
I don't cry anymore.

19:11.080 --> 19:11.920
Only…

19:12.640 --> 19:14.440
Only kids cry.

19:14.520 --> 19:16.480
I'm an adult now.

19:16.560 --> 19:18.000
When I face any problems,

19:18.080 --> 19:20.680
I should think about how to resolve them.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.200
I can't cry all the time.

19:23.960 --> 19:25.160
If you think

19:25.240 --> 19:26.680
that only kids get to cry,

19:27.600 --> 19:29.320
then you can always be a kid.

19:31.120 --> 19:32.440
I'll provide for you.

19:38.040 --> 19:38.880
All right?

19:52.680 --> 19:53.800
Are you homesick?

19:58.600 --> 19:59.520
Let's go home then.

20:01.440 --> 20:02.600
I'll take some days off

20:02.680 --> 20:03.680
and go home with you.

20:05.440 --> 20:06.760
And you can quit this job

20:06.840 --> 20:08.600
if you don't feel like continuing it.

20:09.160 --> 20:10.400
What's wrong with this company?

20:11.360 --> 20:13.240
They keep giving my Zhizhi a hard time.

20:15.080 --> 20:16.160
I must have

20:16.640 --> 20:19.320
a serious talk with your superior.

20:21.240 --> 20:22.160
Honestly.

20:23.200 --> 20:25.040
You're acting like a parent now.

20:25.840 --> 20:27.000
Yes.

20:27.080 --> 20:29.240
Perhaps I've become more greedy.

20:30.080 --> 20:31.240
I want

20:31.320 --> 20:32.920
to be more than just your boyfriend.

20:34.400 --> 20:36.560
I also want to be someone you can rely on.

20:38.640 --> 20:39.520
May I?

21:02.120 --> 21:03.040
I also want

21:03.120 --> 21:04.560
to be someone you rely on.

21:06.920 --> 21:07.840
You can

21:09.200 --> 21:12.240
share your joys and sorrows with me.

21:16.800 --> 21:17.640
All right.

21:19.040 --> 21:21.840
Then we'll rely on each other.

21:26.760 --> 21:28.520
So now can you tell me

21:28.600 --> 21:30.360
what happened at work?

21:43.040 --> 21:44.200
Zhizhi.

21:45.960 --> 21:47.800
I know that Jiang Ying went to see you.

21:52.600 --> 21:53.760
Don't worry.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.800
I went to her

21:56.960 --> 21:58.000
and warned her today.

21:59.160 --> 22:00.920
She won't harass you anymore.

22:07.800 --> 22:08.720
Zhizhi.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.120
You didn't tell me

22:14.200 --> 22:16.320
that you're having trouble at work

22:17.040 --> 22:18.800
and that Jiang Ying came to you.

22:19.680 --> 22:21.880
You don't have
to take on everything alone.

22:23.640 --> 22:24.720
Promise me.

22:26.160 --> 22:27.280
You'll tell me first thing

22:27.960 --> 22:30.120
when you run into problems, okay?

22:35.040 --> 22:36.280
I will let you know.

22:38.360 --> 22:40.160
I didn't tell you about Jiang Ying

22:41.520 --> 22:42.920
because I've grown up

22:43.000 --> 22:44.200
and I can handle it.

22:45.080 --> 22:46.560
You don't have to worry about me.

22:47.600 --> 22:49.760
I won't let her pick on me
without doing anything.

22:50.960 --> 22:52.800
I can protect myself.

22:54.520 --> 22:55.920
I can protect you too.

23:11.320 --> 23:12.280
What's the matter?

23:15.080 --> 23:16.000
I feel

23:17.920 --> 23:19.560
that my Zhizhi really has grown up.

24:02.800 --> 24:05.040
SILLY DOG TRANSFERRED 1,000 YUAN

24:13.360 --> 24:14.880
VOICE CALL

24:14.960 --> 24:15.800
SILLY DOG

24:22.320 --> 24:23.680
-Hello?
<i>-Hello.</i>

24:24.280 --> 24:26.240
<i>Have you received
your pocket money and allowance?</i>

24:29.360 --> 24:30.360
What time is your flight?

24:30.440 --> 24:31.280
I'll see you off.

24:32.760 --> 24:34.120
<i>Don't act like you care about me.</i>

24:34.200 --> 24:35.120
<i>Accept the money.</i>

24:35.200 --> 24:36.200
<i>You're scaring me.</i>

24:37.480 --> 24:38.560
Well,

24:38.640 --> 24:40.400
when will you come to visit me again?

24:41.520 --> 24:42.520
<i>When I have spare time.</i>

24:43.520 --> 24:44.520
<i>Don't skip meals</i>

24:44.600 --> 24:45.920
<i>and rest if you feel tired.</i>

24:47.800 --> 24:49.520
<i>Also, don't throw tantrums at Duan Jiaxu</i>

24:49.600 --> 24:50.680
<i>all the time.</i>

24:51.280 --> 24:53.480
-I never do that.
<i>-Fine.</i>

24:53.560 --> 24:56.080
-I--
<i>-Okay. I'm hanging up. Bye.</i>

25:07.800 --> 25:09.000
<i>I want</i>

25:09.080 --> 25:10.560
<i>to be more than just your boyfriend.</i>

25:12.560 --> 25:14.720
I also want to be someone you can rely on.

25:16.440 --> 25:18.480
I didn't tell you about Jiang Ying

25:19.680 --> 25:21.040
because I've grown up

25:21.120 --> 25:22.280
and I can handle it.

25:23.120 --> 25:24.680
You don't have to worry about me.

25:25.640 --> 25:28.080
I won't let her pick on me
without doing anything.

25:28.880 --> 25:30.720
I can protect myself.

25:32.440 --> 25:34.120
I can protect you too.

25:35.520 --> 25:36.680
I feel

25:38.440 --> 25:40.440
that my Zhizhi really has grown up.

25:52.840 --> 25:54.560
That concludes the product budget summary.

25:54.640 --> 25:56.160
Next, let's have our team member

25:56.240 --> 25:57.840
propose the idea for the ad.

26:00.640 --> 26:02.720
The idea for this ad

26:02.800 --> 26:05.720
uses a little girl's perspective.

26:06.280 --> 26:08.040
This little girl has suffered

26:08.120 --> 26:09.880
from allergies since childhood,

26:09.960 --> 26:12.040
so she can't eat or drink

26:12.120 --> 26:13.280
what she wants.

26:13.360 --> 26:15.720
She starts using our skincare product

26:15.800 --> 26:18.600
and is protected by a little spirit.

26:18.680 --> 26:20.040
This little spirit

26:20.120 --> 26:21.880
is a symbol of the Dongjie lotion.

26:21.960 --> 26:25.000
This ad will be about 30 seconds long.

26:25.080 --> 26:26.880
The plot revolves

26:26.960 --> 26:29.640
around the little girl and Dongjie lotion.

26:29.720 --> 26:33.000
We'll build a character image
for the users,

26:33.080 --> 26:34.680
so that the image of a little girl

26:34.760 --> 26:36.240
can always remind them of Dongjie.

26:36.320 --> 26:38.240
Aside from that,

26:38.320 --> 26:40.000
we can build a brand image

26:40.080 --> 26:41.760
to portray the traits of the brand,

26:41.840 --> 26:44.360
which are pure, gorgeous, and reassuring.

26:44.880 --> 26:46.120
Lastly, we can highlight

26:46.200 --> 26:48.600
that Dongjie is a natural product.

26:48.680 --> 26:49.560
That's the gist of it.

26:49.640 --> 26:52.440
We'll proceed with the details afterward.

26:54.680 --> 26:57.560
I like the story of the allergic girl.

27:00.320 --> 27:03.000
But I think the production fee

27:03.080 --> 27:04.760
might exceed our budget.

27:06.680 --> 27:07.840
We offer you a fair price.

27:07.920 --> 27:10.240
The difficulty comes
with the character design

27:10.320 --> 27:12.080
and the shooting.

27:12.160 --> 27:14.160
Anyway, I believe
that the more challenging it is,

27:14.240 --> 27:16.160
the more we must try it.

27:16.240 --> 27:17.360
Also, I'm confident

27:17.440 --> 27:18.960
that we can provide you

27:19.040 --> 27:21.480
with a perfect outcome.

27:22.480 --> 27:23.400
All right.

27:24.280 --> 27:25.560
We've decided

27:25.640 --> 27:27.200
to use the story of the little girl.

27:27.760 --> 27:29.120
Sir, what about the contract?

27:29.880 --> 27:31.760
Make amendments to the contract.

27:31.840 --> 27:32.880
Sign it quickly.

27:33.720 --> 27:35.280
This will be

27:35.360 --> 27:37.120
a perfect collaboration.

27:37.200 --> 27:38.520
Thank you.

27:38.600 --> 27:39.440
Let's go.

27:39.520 --> 27:41.520
-Xiaoyu, see them off.
-See them off.

27:41.600 --> 27:43.080
-This way, please.
-Okay. Be careful.

27:52.080 --> 27:52.960
Sang Zhi.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.480
You're so smart.

27:57.560 --> 27:58.920
You have an amazing brain.

27:59.000 --> 28:01.240
You're sharp as a blade,
coming up with this brilliant idea

28:01.320 --> 28:02.880
and securing this project.

28:03.360 --> 28:04.320
Do you know what this is?

28:05.080 --> 28:08.040
You've done an excellent job, rookie.

28:09.280 --> 28:10.240
If you pull your weight

28:10.320 --> 28:12.320
and do well on this proposal,

28:12.960 --> 28:15.240
I'll give the entire team a bonus!

28:16.160 --> 28:17.680
Thank you, Mr. Zhang!

28:17.760 --> 28:18.800
Brilliant, Mr. Zhang!

28:18.880 --> 28:20.200
I've never seen you all

28:20.280 --> 28:21.720
with such happy faces.

28:21.800 --> 28:22.840
You're so money-obsessed.

28:22.920 --> 28:23.760
Do your work well!

28:23.840 --> 28:24.840
-Okay!
-You've got this!

28:24.920 --> 28:26.480
-Thank you, Mr. Zhang!
-Thank you, Mr. Zhang!

28:27.720 --> 28:29.200
Sang Zhi, this is thanks to you.

28:29.280 --> 28:30.240
No problem.

28:30.840 --> 28:31.880
Xiaowan,

28:31.960 --> 28:33.840
your internship is about to be over.

28:33.920 --> 28:35.840
I'll treat you two to a meal this weekend.

28:35.920 --> 28:38.360
-Sure!
-I can't make it this weekend.

28:38.440 --> 28:39.760
I have plans.

28:39.840 --> 28:40.680
Do you?

28:41.200 --> 28:42.080
Is it a date?

28:42.720 --> 28:44.120
Why are you so nosy?

28:49.800 --> 28:51.400
I'm inside now.

28:51.480 --> 28:52.400
Where are you?

29:01.840 --> 29:02.840
I'm going to…

29:09.520 --> 29:10.440
Have you arrived?

29:15.360 --> 29:16.400
What are you doing there?

29:25.440 --> 29:27.040
Wait for me there. I'll come to get you.

29:29.200 --> 29:31.120
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

29:31.200 --> 29:32.120
Will it be…

29:39.600 --> 29:42.120
Change into slippers first.

29:55.480 --> 29:56.560
Take a look around first.

29:59.000 --> 30:00.280
There's a kitchen over here.

30:03.120 --> 30:04.920
There are two bedrooms.

30:08.840 --> 30:10.680
This room has a bigger balcony.

30:11.240 --> 30:12.200
It's your room.

30:15.240 --> 30:16.280
Does this mean

30:17.480 --> 30:19.160
that we are living together?

30:20.600 --> 30:21.680
No.

30:21.760 --> 30:24.080
I thought of giving you a place to rest

30:24.640 --> 30:26.920
when you get tired from studying.

30:31.800 --> 30:33.320
Let's go eat.

30:36.080 --> 30:36.920
By the way,

30:38.440 --> 30:40.200
you haven't told me

30:40.960 --> 30:43.120
how much the monthly rent is.

30:43.200 --> 30:44.360
Is it expensive?

30:44.960 --> 30:46.720
If it's expensive,

30:46.800 --> 30:48.360
you don't have to rent this place.

30:49.440 --> 30:50.920
Are you afraid that I can't afford it?

30:53.080 --> 30:54.000
No.

30:55.000 --> 30:56.400
I'm afraid

30:56.480 --> 30:57.520
that you are wasting money.

30:58.960 --> 31:00.480
I can afford this.

31:01.320 --> 31:03.240
I'm renting this place

31:03.320 --> 31:04.480
because it's near your campus.

31:04.560 --> 31:06.640
You can have more time to rest.

31:11.600 --> 31:12.800
Give me your hand.

31:15.640 --> 31:16.800
Why?

31:22.960 --> 31:24.160
From now on,

31:24.240 --> 31:25.640
this is our home.

32:26.160 --> 32:27.480
Hello, ma'am.

32:27.560 --> 32:29.600
This is room 202.

32:29.680 --> 32:31.840
I think something is wrong
with the air conditioner.

32:31.920 --> 32:32.840
What can I do?

32:32.920 --> 32:34.200
<i>It's summer break</i>

32:34.280 --> 32:35.640
<i>and the technician isn't on duty.</i>

32:35.720 --> 32:36.720
<i>No one can fix it.</i>

32:36.800 --> 32:38.560
<i>You'll have to wait until next semester.</i>

32:39.640 --> 32:42.240
Can I hire a technician myself?

32:42.800 --> 32:43.880
<i>I don't recommend that.</i>

32:43.960 --> 32:46.560
<i>If the fix makes it worse,
you'll have to pay for it.</i>

32:46.640 --> 32:48.080
But the room is really hot.

32:48.960 --> 32:51.360
<i>You'll have to find another solution.</i>

32:54.000 --> 32:55.520
All right. Bye.

33:13.000 --> 33:14.440
Hello, Jiaxu.

33:15.080 --> 33:16.520
What are you doing, kiddo?

33:16.600 --> 33:17.480
Have you had dinner?

33:17.560 --> 33:18.720
<i>I've eaten.</i>

33:18.800 --> 33:20.440
<i>But the air conditioner
in my dorm isn't working.</i>

33:20.520 --> 33:21.640
<i>The room is stifling.</i>

33:27.120 --> 33:28.040
I see.

33:30.560 --> 33:31.640
I'll go and fetch you now.

33:33.600 --> 33:35.200
Fetch me to go where?

33:36.200 --> 33:37.360
My place.

33:42.320 --> 33:43.560
Wait for me on campus.

33:43.640 --> 33:44.880
I'll be on my way now.

33:47.280 --> 33:48.160
All right.

34:02.400 --> 34:03.640
It's so refreshing.

34:03.720 --> 34:04.680
Here.

34:04.760 --> 34:05.880
It must be hot in your room.

34:07.840 --> 34:08.760
Change your shoes.

34:15.679 --> 34:16.560
Take a look.

34:17.040 --> 34:18.360
See what you want to eat.

34:19.840 --> 34:22.960
I bought all your favorite snacks for you.

34:27.159 --> 34:31.040
Today, I'll have this

34:31.880 --> 34:33.000
and…

34:35.960 --> 34:36.840
This.

34:36.920 --> 34:38.040
Do you want to try this?

34:43.600 --> 34:45.239
I'm all good with these.

34:46.080 --> 34:47.239
I'll eat the rest tomorrow.

34:47.760 --> 34:48.679
Okay.

34:51.400 --> 34:52.280
Have a taste.

34:56.760 --> 34:57.640
You go first.

34:57.720 --> 34:58.600
Don't you want it?

34:58.680 --> 34:59.960
You take the first bite.

35:04.160 --> 35:05.080
Is it good?

35:08.680 --> 35:10.760
You can have these every day

35:10.840 --> 35:12.120
if you move in.

35:15.320 --> 35:16.680
I'll go and tidy up the place.

35:28.400 --> 35:30.320
Do you want to take a shower?

35:30.400 --> 35:32.880
I've prepared the toiletries for you
in the bathroom.

35:38.840 --> 35:40.800
Weren't you sweating in your dorm?

35:45.440 --> 35:46.800
Go ahead and wash up.

35:47.680 --> 35:49.680
All right. I'll go now.

36:11.720 --> 36:12.800
Are you done?

36:13.360 --> 36:15.760
<i>Why did he change into pajamas?</i>

36:16.760 --> 36:17.960
Why are you standing there?

36:21.400 --> 36:23.440
I'm working.

36:27.640 --> 36:28.920
I'm playing a game.

36:31.280 --> 36:33.240
Is it the same game as before?

36:34.680 --> 36:35.800
Come and play with me.

36:43.680 --> 36:45.040
Have you tried this before?

36:49.440 --> 36:50.600
Let me show you.

36:56.680 --> 36:57.760
The first skill.

36:59.880 --> 37:01.440
Shoot. Shoot outward.

37:01.520 --> 37:02.800
The second skill is range.

37:08.320 --> 37:09.560
I'm teaching you how to play.

37:13.120 --> 37:14.200
Give it a try.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.360
Here.

37:22.120 --> 37:23.120
Buy the equipment.

37:25.560 --> 37:26.800
Attack them with the skills.

37:37.840 --> 37:39.520
Focus on the game.

37:51.480 --> 37:52.480
What should I do now?

37:54.120 --> 37:55.760
Run.

37:56.520 --> 37:57.400
Run.

37:59.320 --> 38:01.280
It's fine. You did very well.

38:01.360 --> 38:02.800
I'll go get some snacks.

38:07.080 --> 38:08.040
You…

38:08.640 --> 38:09.560
Let me see.

38:13.680 --> 38:14.640
Take your time.

38:14.720 --> 38:15.560
I…

38:17.240 --> 38:19.360
Can I unbutton it?

39:10.480 --> 39:11.680
It's done.

40:11.440 --> 40:12.560
You have

40:13.200 --> 40:14.960
to work tomorrow, right?

40:17.440 --> 40:19.200
Maybe you should go to bed now.

40:23.320 --> 40:24.200
Yes.

40:25.960 --> 40:27.760
I am a bit sleepy.

40:27.840 --> 40:30.040
I think I had better rest now.

40:30.800 --> 40:32.560
I need to go to work early.

40:36.400 --> 40:37.680
I still have some work to do.

40:44.640 --> 40:45.920
Remember to lock your door.

42:13.120 --> 42:14.240
Good morning.

42:14.320 --> 42:15.360
Good morning.

42:21.440 --> 42:23.040
I'll make breakfast for you.

42:24.400 --> 42:26.480
I'll help you.

42:47.280 --> 42:48.440
Try it.

42:51.240 --> 42:52.520
By the way,

42:52.600 --> 42:54.640
are you getting off work late today?

42:54.720 --> 42:56.480
Tell me before you leave.

42:56.560 --> 42:57.680
I'll pick you up.

42:58.240 --> 42:59.400
There's no need.

43:00.080 --> 43:01.760
I can come back myself.

43:02.840 --> 43:05.600
Also, isn't your game
going into the testing phase soon?

43:05.680 --> 43:07.800
My internship is ending soon.

43:07.880 --> 43:09.000
After that,

43:09.080 --> 43:11.920
we can have more free time to hang out.

43:12.880 --> 43:13.840
All right.

43:13.920 --> 43:16.760
When the testing phase is over,

43:16.840 --> 43:18.720
we can go anywhere you want.
